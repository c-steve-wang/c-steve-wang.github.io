I am a **Ph.D. candidate** at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), advised by [Prof. Susu Xu](http://susu-xu.com).  
I began my academic journey with a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** from [Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020, followed by a **Master of Science in Computer Science** at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/) in 2023, where I worked with [Prof. Xiaojiang Du](https://www.stevens.edu/profile/xdu16).  
From 2024 to 2025, I was a **Graduate Visiting Scholar** at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/).  

These experiences have shaped my interdisciplinary approach to leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for disaster management and beyond.  

**I am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities or full-time AI Researcher/Engineer positions.**  

My research interests broadly lie in Machine Learning (**ML**), Natural Language Processing (**NLP**), and Large Language Models (**LLM**).  
More specifically, my recent research focuses on: <br>
**(i) LLM applications in Disaster Management** ([CrisisNLP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420924004424)); <br>
**(ii) Post-training for LLMs** ([Mosaic-IT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13326), [RuleR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15938)); <br>
**(iii) Multi-Modal LLMs (MLLMs)** ([TRIG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04974), [CaughtCheating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00045)); <br>
I am also interested in and now exploring **RAG**([FLARE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17701)), **Agent** ([StreetDesinger](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00045)), and **RL**. 


I am open to collaborations and opportunities to continue advancing AI for impactful real-world applications.
