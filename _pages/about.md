Hello! I'm a Ph.D. student at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), guided by [Prof. Susu Xu](http://susu-xu.com). My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020, followed by a Master of Science in Computer Science from [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/) in 2023. Currently, at Stony Brook University, my research is focused on investigating the application of advanced Large Language Models in disaster response. This involves integrating crowd-sensing data to augment real-time situational awareness and enhance crisis management strategies.

Throughout my academic path, I have built a strong foundation in computer science, driven by a passion to apply this knowledge for creating tangible, real-world impacts. This journey has been enriched by my experiences at various institutions, including a role as a Research Intern at the [Analytics and Information Security Lab](https://www.stevens.edu/aiseclab) under [Prof. Xiaojiang Du](https://www.stevens.edu/profile/xdu16) and as a Research Assistant at the [MoE Key Lab for Intelligent Networks & Network Security](https://nskeylab.xjtu.edu.cn/) under [Prof. Zhongmin Cai](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/zmcai/english-version).

I welcome you to my professional space, where I share my research developments and actively seek collaborative opportunities in the field of large language models and disaster response.
