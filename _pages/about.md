Hello! I'm a Ph.D. student at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), mentored by [Prof. Susu Xu](http://susu-xu.com). I began my academic journey in computer science with a Bachelor of Science from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020, followed by a Master of Science from [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/) in 2023. At Stony Brook, I'm exploring the application of Large Language Models in disaster response, focusing on integrating crowd-sensing data to improve crisis management.

My experiences as a Research Intern at the [Analytics and Information Security Lab](https://www.stevens.edu/aiseclab) under [Prof. Xiaojiang Du](https://www.stevens.edu/profile/xdu16) and as a Research Assistant at the [MoE Key Lab for Intelligent Networks & Network Security](https://nskeylab.xjtu.edu.cn/) under [Prof. Zhongmin Cai](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/zmcai/english-version) have been instrumental in shaping my approach to computer science. This diverse background has uniquely positioned me to contribute to the evolving field of AI in disaster response, bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical, real-world applications.
