Hello! I'm a Ph.D. student at Stony Brook University, where I am privileged to work under the guidance of Prof. Susu Xu. My academic journey in computer science began at Xi'an Jiaotong University, leading to a Master's from Stevens Institute of Technology. Currently, my research is centered on leveraging large language models for disaster response, blending AI innovation with humanitarian goals. This work is an extension of my comprehensive academic background, which began in 2020 with my undergraduate studies. My goal is to contribute to more effective crisis management through technology. This professional space serves as a platform to share my research progress and establish meaningful collaborations.
