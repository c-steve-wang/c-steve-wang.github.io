Hello! I'm a Ph.D. student at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), guided by [Prof. Susu Xu](http://susu-xu.com). My academic journey in computer science began with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) in 2020, followed by a Master of Science in Computer Science from [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/) in 2023. My research endeavors at Stony Brook University revolve around investigating the application of advanced Large Language Models in disaster response, specifically focusing on integrating crowd-sensing data to augment real-time situational awareness.

My academic path has been characterized by a strong foundation in computer science, underpinned by a passion for applying this knowledge to create tangible, real-world impacts. This journey has been enriched by my experiences at various institutions, including serving as a Research Intern at the [Analytics and Information Security Lab](https://www.stevens.edu/aiseclab) under [Prof. Xiaojiang Du](https://www.stevens.edu/profile/xdu16) and as a Research Assistant at the [MoE Key Lab for Intelligent Networks & Network Security](https://nskeylab.xjtu.edu.cn/) under [Prof. Zhongmin Cai](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/zmcai/english-version).

My website serves as a professional portal where I share my research developments and actively seek opportunities for collaboration and knowledge exchange in the field of large language models and disaster response.
