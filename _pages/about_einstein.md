Hello! I'm a Ph.D. student at Stony Brook University, guided by [Prof. Susu Xu](http://susu-xu.com). My academic journey in computer science began with a Bachelor's degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2020, followed by a Master's degree from Stevens Institute of Technology in 2023. Currently, I am immersed in research that explores the application of large language models for disaster response at Stony Brook. This work aims to integrate advanced AI technologies with humanitarian efforts to enhance crisis management. My journey into the realm of large language models is built upon a solid foundation in computer science and a commitment to creating real-world impact. Welcome to my professional space, where I share my research developments and eagerly seek collaborative opportunities.
